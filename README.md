# EasyFX

EasyFX is a custom pedal-board software application. Patches are loaded via Pure Data and the graphical interface allows easy control over it.

How to run:

```shell
./init.sh # this assumes you have git and pip installed
pip install -r requirements.txt
./entry.py
```

Pyenv recomended for python version management (hence .python-version file).
